# CPURenderer

Implementation of 3d graphics with explicit steps in renderer pipeline 
so that vertex transformations, clipping, rasterization and shading are done in code (and thus runs on CPU)
It uses olcPixelEngine (https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) to create window and to put pixels on it
