# CPURenderer

Implementation of 3d graphics with explicit steps in renderer pipeline<br>
so that vertex transformations, clipping, rasterization and shading are done in code (and thus runs on CPU)<br>
It uses olcPixelEngine (https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) to create window and to put pixels on it<br>
